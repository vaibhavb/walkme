                    protecting your privacy. This privacy statement applies to the data collected by 
                    Microsoft through the Microsoft services that display or link to this privacy 
                    statement (the &#8220;Service&#8221;); it does not apply to data collected through other

                The Service connects with 
                    Microsoft HealthVault to allow you to use certain information from your 
                    HealthVault account in the Service and/or to store information from the Service 
                    in your HealthVault account. You can review the types of information and access 
                    this Service will have 1) in the information presented to you when you authorize 
                    access between the Service and HealthVault, and 2) in your HealthVault account 
                    under the &#8220;Sharing&#8221; tab, where you can also turn off access by the Service at 
                    any time. For more information about data collection and use practices for 
                    HealthVault accounts, please read the

                <div class="form-description">
                We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or 
                    allows us to contact you. The information we collect may include participant 
                    e-mail addresses, aerobic exercise, heart rate and weight information. 
                    Some Services are designed to enable you to post or provide information to be 
                    displayed in the Service. As the author of communication, you may be identified 
                    by a nickname that you choose. In order to help prevent your personal 
                    information from being gathered and used by others for inappropriate or harmful 
                    purposes, you should be cautious about including personal information in your

                The Service asks you to enter 
                    an identifier and password to sign in. The Service may accept either Windows

                    or any particular OpenID provider. Before you choose to use OpenID with the 
                    Service, we recommend that you evaluate the security and privacy commitments 
                    offered by the OpenID issuer and decide if they are appropriate for your 
                    HealthVault account. </div>

                    Live ID or your Microsoft Passport Network credentials. After you create your Windows Live ID, you can 
                    use the same credentials to sign into many different Microsoft sites and 
                    services, as well as those of select Microsoft partners, that display the 
                    Windows Live ID or Microsoft Passport Network logos. By signing in on one 
                    Microsoft site or service, you may be automatically signed in when you visit 
                    other Microsoft sites and services. To learn more about how your credential

                    third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on Microsoft 
                    web pages. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your 
                    computer in order to recognize your computer each time they send you an online 
                    advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, 
                    or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine 
                    which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver 
                    targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. 
                    Microsoft does not have access to the cookies that may be placed by the 
                    third-party ad servers or ad networks.</div>
